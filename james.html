        The form tag is used to create a container where all the inputs for a form
        must be put inside.
        The attributes that are required are name, id, and method.

        name gives some descriptive information about what the form will be used for.

        id allows us to reference this form later in fieldsets and other areas of our
        code.

        method has two typical values: get and post. Get is used for forms that do
        not ask for personal infromation (search bars, etc.). Post is used for forms
        that ask for personal information (login and signup pages, etc.).

    <form name="Basketball shots" id="ball shots" method="get">
        <!--
            This is a text input. type="text", name, and id are all required attributes.
            The required attibute is only necessary when you want to make sure the user
            has to fill in the input before submitting the form.

            The type attribute defines the type of input.
            The anme attribute defines the variable name that would be used for the
            input when the data gets passed to the server (requires back-end scripting,
            which is beyond the scope of this course).
            The id attribute allows us to reference the input from the label and from
            other parts of our code.

            All inputs need a label with the for attibute that links the label to the
            input using the inputs's id attribute.
            When an input is required, it is important to include the word required
            in the label's text.
        -->
        <label for="Basketball shots">What's a cool move sir Legal James should try out? [required if you wanna be sir Leg James friend.]</label>
        <input type="text" name="Cool move." id="ball shots" required />
        <!--
            This is an email input. It requires type, name, and id.

            Optional attributes are minlength to define the minimum length entered by
            the user and maxlength to define the maximum length entered.
        -->
        <!-- <label for="email-address">Please Enter Your E-mail Address:</label>
        <input type="email" name="email" id="email-address" minlength="6" maxlength="40" /> -->
        <!--
            This is a password input. type="password", name, and id are all required
            attributes.
            As always, each input needs a label with the for attribute to link the label
            to an input.

            I have commented this input out because I will no be needing a password
            input for this form.
        -->
        <!-- <label for="password">Please Enter Your Password:</label>
        <input type="password" name="userPassword" id="password" minlength="10" /> -->
