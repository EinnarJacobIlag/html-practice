        Anchors are an example of inline elements because, by defualt, they
        only take up the space that they need to.

        We showed the difference between block and inline elements using Developer Tools,
        which we accessed using Ctrl+Shift+I. Developer Tools is helpful to show you the width,
        height, and spacing around an element.

        This is an example of an image tag.
        The src attribute is the location of the image we want to display.
        The src attribute can be an Internet location (i.e., https://www.google.com/...),
        but the best practice is to have your own images folder that stores all the
        images use on your website.

        Note: img is a self-closing tag.
