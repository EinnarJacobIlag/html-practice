    Each element that we create for a website NEEDS to go in the body of the document.

    Most elements start with an opening tag and end with a closing tag.
    In this example, <p> is the opening tag and </p> is the closing tag.
    Inside the opening and closing tags, is the content that you actually want to to display on the website.

    This is an example of a paragraph tag.

  <h1>Hello world!</h1>
  <figurecaption>You open your eyes and see a smiling tree talking to you.</figurecaption>
  <h2>"I glad you're still alive after the fall. You should explore around!"</h2>
  <p>Maybe you should try to find the reason why you're here.</p>
